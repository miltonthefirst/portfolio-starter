      <h3>I'm a Creative Web Developer based in [City]</h3>
      <p>I have a passion for creating clean, user-friendly, and efficient websites. My journey in web development started back in 2020 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together HTML & CSS is fun!</p>
      <p>Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, and a huge corporation. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences.</p>
